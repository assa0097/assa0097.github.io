        <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Ray and Im a <strong><abbr title="Graphic Designer">GD</abbr></strong>. I've been interested in art ever since I was little, expressing myself through paint and play-doh. As I grew older, I loved to discover the different ways companies creatively marketed their products, whether through social media content, packaging, posters, or on their websites.</p>
    <p>I've always been interested in <em>art and design</em> since I was young (helping people was a bonus). I've always loved watching the cartoons from 1990<sup>th</sup>. As I grew older, the fondness grew and it drove me to graphic design. The program provided a bigger skillset in order to continue doing what I love.</p>
